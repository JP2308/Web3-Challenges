
The solution to this contract was as follows:
    1. copy and paste the contract into Remix IDE after obtaining level instance from Ethernaut;
    2. connect metamask as the injected provider, being sure to deploy the Delegation contract in Remix;
    3. call the pwn() function;
    4. call the owner function to confirm that your metamask account is now the owner; and
    5. submit the instance on Ethernaut.
